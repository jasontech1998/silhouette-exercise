# Silhouette

Silhouette is a website built from a Tremor template. It's developed using Tremor and Next.js as an exercise for building marketing landing pages for a computing technology brand.

**Note that Silhouette is a fictional/concept company created for demonstration purposes.**

## About Silhouette

Silhouette represents the future of ambient computing - technology that enhances spaces while fading into the background. Our fictional brand focuses on:

- AI-powered environments that learn and adapt to users
- Seamless integration between devices and spaces
- Intuitive interfaces that respond naturally to human needs
- Sophisticated, unobtrusive technology that complements modern living

The website has been extensively customized from the original Solar template with:

- A custom SVG logo reflecting the Silhouette brand identity
- Updated color scheme from orange to sophisticated black/gray tones
- Enhanced hero section with a new ambient background animation
- Smooth scrolling functionality between page sections
- Subtle fade-in animations for content elements as users navigate
- Redesigned feature sections to highlight ambient computing concepts
- Modified UI components to match the "present but unobtrusive" brand aesthetic
